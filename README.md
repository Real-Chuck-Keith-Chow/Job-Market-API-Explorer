# 🚀 Job Market API Explorer (C++17)

Job Market API Explorer is a modern **C++17 console application** that queries public job listing APIs, displays structured job results, and computes basic market statistics such as **top hiring companies** and **average minimum salary**.

This project is designed to showcase **real-world C++ engineering skills**, including API integration, JSON parsing, networking, and CMake-based builds.

## ✨ Highlights

- 🔌 Live job search via public REST APIs (Adzuna)
- 📊 Aggregates results into useful market statistics
- ⚙️ Modern C++17 with clean, modular design
- 🧰 Industry-standard libraries (libcurl, nlohmann/json)
- 🏗 Cross-platform build using CMake
- 🗄 Optional SQLite persistence layer (scaffolded)

## 🪟 Windows (MinGW) Quick Start — vcpkg

```bash
# 1) Install vcpkg
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git C:\tools\vcpkg
C:\tools\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat

# 2) Install curl
C:\tools\vcpkg\vcpkg install curl:x64-mingw-dynamic --host-triplet x64-mingw-dynamic

# (Optional) SQLite support
C:\tools\vcpkg\vcpkg install sqlite3:x64-mingw-dynamic --host-triplet x64-mingw-dynamic
